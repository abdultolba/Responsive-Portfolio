# Responsive Portfolio

This repository contains the contents of a web project, a responsive and mobile-friendly web portfolio 
built completely from HTML5, SASS/CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The purpose of this project is to review and understand the basics of front end web development, as well
as to learn how to use SASS and npm packages.


The package is completely open source and free to use, as long as it is not re-distributed.

To use this portfolio:

1) Clone the contents of this repository to your local desktop.
2) - The main folder contains three files (`.gitignore`, `package.json`, & `package-lock.json`), as well as two folders (`dist` & `scss`).
   - `dist` contains all the website files; this includes the javascript, html, and css files.
   - `scss` contains the SASS source code that pre-processes the CSS located in `dist`.
3) - Files you may want to change:
   - `index.html`   (The main page of the website, which contains a menu and basic information.)
   - `about.html`   (A secondary page containing information about you.)
   - `contact.html` (A secondary page that allows viewers to reach out to you.)
   - `work.html`    (This page displays samples or examples of the work you have to show.)
